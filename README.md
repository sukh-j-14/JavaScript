# JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey! This repository documents my progress as I explore and master core JavaScript concepts, from the basics to working with the DOM. Each folder represents a step in my learning path, with hands-on code examples and notes.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open any folder and explore the JavaScript files.
3. Run the JS files using Node.js or in the browser console (for DOM examples, open the HTML files in your browser).

Feel free to use these examples as a reference or starting point for your own JavaScript journey!
